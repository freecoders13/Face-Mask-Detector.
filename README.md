# Face-Mask-Detector.
Task#4 as an "IoT and Computer Vision" intern at THE SPARKS FOUNDATION. A real time Face Mask Detector using MobileNet, OpenCV, Tensorflow and keras, sklearn, Numpy, and Matplotlib. In this project, I've used transfer learning using 'imagenet' weights and further trained my model on DNN. I've implemented YOLO to make it a real time face mask detector using webcam.
